[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/unparser.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/unparser)

Generate equivalent source for ASTs from whitequarks [parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser).
Excluding the macruby extensions the parser gem implemnents on top of ruby syntax.

Excluding the MacRuby / RubyMotion extensions the parser gem implemnents on top of MRI ruby syntax starting with parser release 2.3.
If you feel the need to get them supported, contact me.

This library is able to reproduce 100% of ruby 1.9, 2.0 and 2.1 syntax. Including its own source code.

It serves well for [mutant](https://github.com/mbj/mutant) mutators and the in-memory vendoring for self hosting,
and other tooling.

Usage
-----

```ruby
require 'unparser'
Unparser.unparse(your_ast) # => "the code"
```

To preserve the comments from the source:

```ruby
require 'parser/current'
require 'unparser'
ast, comments = Parser::CurrentRuby.parse_with_comments(your_source)
Unparser.unparse(ast, comments) # => "the code # with comments"
```

Passing in manually constructed AST:
```ruby
require 'parser/current'
require 'unparser'

module YourHelper
  def s(type, *children)
    Parser::AST::Node.new(type, children)
  end
end

include YourHelper

node = s(:def,
  :foo,
  s(:args,
    s(:arg, :x)
  ),
  s(:send,
    s(:lvar, :x),
    :+,
    s(:int, 3)
  )
)

Unparser.unparse(node) # => "def foo(x)\n  x + 3\nend"
```

Note: DO NOT attempt to pass in nodes generated via `AST::Sexp#s`, these ones return
API incompatible `AST::Node` instances, unparser needs `Parser::AST::Node` instances.


Equivalent vs identical:

```ruby
require 'unparser'

code = <<-RUBY
%w(foo bar)
RUBY

node = Parser::CurrentRuby.parse(code)

generated = Unparser.unparse(node) # ["foo", "bar"], NOT %w(foo bar) !

code == generated                            # false, not identical code
Parser::CurrentRuby.parse(generated) == node # true, but identical AST
```

Summary: unparser does not reproduce your source! It produces equivalent source.

Testing:
--------

Unparser currently successfully round trips almost all ruby code around. Using MRI-2.0.0.
If there is a non round trippable example that is NOT subjected to known [Limitations](#limitations).
please report a bug.

On CI unparser is currently tested against The Ruby Spec Suite with minor [excludes](https://github.com/mbj/unparser/blob/master/spec/integrations.yml).

Limitations:
------------

Source parsed with magic encoding headers other than UTF-8 and that have literal strings.
where parts can be represented in UTF-8 will fail to get reproduced.

Please note: If you are on 1.9.3 or any 1.9 mode ruby and use UTF-8 encoded source via the magic encoding header:
Unparser does not reproduce these.

A fix might be possible and requires some guessing or parser metadata the raw AST does not carry.

Example:

Original-Source:
```ruby
# -*- encoding: binary -*-

"\x98\x76\xAB\xCD\x45\x32\xEF\x01\x01\x23\x45\x67\x89\xAB\xCD\xEF"
```

Original-AST:
```
(str "\x98v\xAB\xCDE2\xEF\x01\x01#Eg\x89\xAB\xCD\xEF")
```

Generated-Source:

```ruby
"\x98v\xAB\xCDE2\xEF\x01\x01#Eg\x89\xAB\xCD\xEF"
```

Generated-AST:

```
(str "\x98v\xAB\xCDE2\xEF\u0001\u0001#Eg\x89\xAB\xCD\xEF")
```

Contributing
-------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile or version
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
